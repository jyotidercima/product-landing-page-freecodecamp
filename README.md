#Key Chain Mini Camera - Product landing page
<br>
I created a procuct landing page as a project under freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Course here I found this product "Key Chain Mini Camera" appealing to me thats why I created the project on this product.<br> 
In this project I have used Flex-box and created buy cards to buy from three different sources and tried making it responsive using media queries, <br>I also attached a youtube video reviewing the product.
